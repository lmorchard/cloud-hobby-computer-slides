    <meta name="description" content="Thanks to Moore’s Law and weird business models on the Internet, a lot of computing power can be had free-of-charge.

          <h2>What is a <strong>hobby computer</strong>?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Around the time I was born, home computers were sold in kit form. 

            You got circuit boards and a bag of parts.

            You assembled the thing yourself and learned a bunch about hardware and software.

            This picture is of the Rum 80, a computer built from scratch in the 80s
            by Lumir Vanek from the Czech Republic. That's even cooler, because 
            this guy made up his own kit.

          <h2>What is <strong>free</strong>?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Lots of folks around here are familiar with free as in beer versus free as in speech.

            Well, the computers I'm talking about are the free beer. Your software is the free speech.
            
            I think it's crucial to consider whether any particular offering of free beer 
            helps you in your freedom of expression, or whether it serves to lock you in.

            And of course, these computers are free with asterisks.

            But, I think you can and should navigate these asterisks for fun and learning.

            And that leads me to the issue of what is yours. I've heard it said that if you can't fix it, you don't own it.
            <br>
            I would also say that it's only yours if you can pick it up and move it somewhere else. 
            At least, in the case of software. Houses might be a bit harder to move.

          <h1>Borrowing Other People's Computers for Your Hobbies</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            When you're using the cloud, that's what you're doing: You're borrowing other people's computers
            and you'll have to give them back at some point. Often that time is measured in milliseconds.
            <br>
            But, whenever you have your hands on a tool, borrowed or not, you can end up learning
            and making some useful things.
            <br>
            Really, what I'm going to attempt to do is describe an approach to
            thinking about and evaluating cloud services:
            If it's free, what's the catch?
            Will you learn something useful in using it?
            Can you walk away cleanly with stuff you've made and put it somewhere else?
            Or, are you locked in and stuck when you have to give back what you've borrowed?

              One of the first things I want to do with the cloud is find a place to put my stuff. <br>
              And, since most of my hobbies tend to result in software of some kind, GitHub comes in very handy. <br>
              It's kind of like the Facebook of code, with activity streams and comments and such. <br>

            <aside class="notes">
              For example, when I was having fun hacking around with my Raspberry PI, I stashed all my code and experiments on GitHub. <br>
              This turned out really nice, because it meant I could edit things easily on my laptop <br>
              And when I sometimes wiped the SD card for the PI, it was really easy to just pull down a fresh clone of my code to get back to playing <br>
              And since all of this is on the web, I could point friends at some some of the code to ask for advice or just show off <br>

            <aside class="notes">
              So, that's cool: I'm borrowing computers from the folks at GitHub to store my work and publish it on the web.<br>

              Git is hard - But, you know, so were hobby computers. There are some GUI apps for git, 
              but it's mainly a command line tool. To really unlock its power, you will need to learn it's strange ways. <br>

              Git is free as in speech - in fact, it's the revision control system made for and used in the production of Linux <br>
              
              Free beer - unlimited public repositories, no access limits. The only real catch is that they charge for private usage. <br>
              
              Yours - the nice thing about git is that it's a distributed system and 
              you get backups almost for free because all of your stuff exists in its
              entirety wherever you've made a clone <br>
              
              Hackable - github offers interesting APIs to access your data and use with other services<br>

            <h2>Travis CI</h2>
            <img class="fragment" src="img/travis-parsec-patrol.png" width="95%">
            <aside class="notes">
              So, the intent of Travis CI is run your tests for your code.
              <br>
              What you can see in this screenshot is Travis starting up a Linux machine and running 
              the tests for a video game I was working on.
              <br>
              The neat thing is that it integrates with GitHub. Every time I push out a change, 
              Travis gets a notification via the GitHub API and schedules a fresh test run.
              <br>
              Travis will also get notifications when someone has submitted a Pull Request to propose 
              a change to my project, and so kick off tests to tell me whether this new contribution 
              passes the tests.
              <br>

            <aside class="notes">
              But, there are other things Travis can do before, during, or after running tests.
              <br>
              Something I wanted to do with this video game is to publish a new version of it to
              GitHub Pages, every time I pushed out a change that passed all my tests.
              <br>
              So, here, you can see some complicated glue code I wrote which does just that.
              The neat thing is that Travis let's you put encrypted things into the configuration
              so that you can put things like a GitHub API key in there to give Travis access
              to push to GitHub Pages on your behalf.

              slow - it will sometimes take awhile for travis to get around to running your tests

            * I use Google docs spreadsheets to help me make internet spaceship money in EVE Online

            * While there are lots of spreadsheets out there, some even Open Source, my particular
            usage here is fairly tied to Google Docs. It uses Google's own proprietary formula functions
            to access web APIs to look up market prices in game. 
            
            * If Google Spreadsheets ever goes away, I will probably use any work I've done here.
            So, I try not to do too much here beyond kind of throwaway scratchpad work. Anything
            more than that, and I try to shift the effort into writing my own tools that work on
            computers I own, or on Heroku.

            <h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              * Amazon Web Services is kind of like the uber cloud. Almost any kind of computer
              you want to borrow, they have it in Virtual Machine form.

              * For example, I wanted to try running an old-school DOS BBS but make it accessible
              from the internet instead of from a dial-up phone line. But, it only worked on Windows 2000
              or earlier. Well, it turns out they have ready made computers with Windows 2000 installed.
              So, I fired one of those up and spent a weekend playing with BBS software.

              * AWS has a free tier that you can use for a year as a new customer.  
              Me, I've been a customer since early 2006, before there even was a free tier.
              But, you can do quite a lot with that before your first year runs out.

              * Still, that said, much of AWS is so cheap for personal use that it's almost-free beer.

              * For example, I moved my personal blog.lmorchard.com from WordPress to my own
              system that publishes to Amazon S3. I pay a few pennies a month to keep it running.

              (( git + gulp + Amazon S3 example? ))
